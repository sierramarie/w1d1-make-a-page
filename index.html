            <h2>About the breed</h2>
            <p>The breed originiated around the 1800's. The breed was created by mating bulldogs and terriers together. They used to be known as "nanny dogs" because of how well they behaved with children and in a family environment. There are actually 5 different types of "pit bulls", even though most people tend to associate the term "pit bull" with one certain breed. The term "pit bull" originated from people using the dogs to cattle and herd bulls in the pits during bull fights/rodeos. </p>

            <h2>Characteristics of the breed</h2>
            <blockquote>Typically a medium sized dog with a short, thin coat. Usually seen as an athletic, energized breed. They're typically very family oriented and protective, yet some people report that they aren't the best guard dogs because they get so excited when people come around. They do tend to need some obedience training as puppies since they are so enthusiastic. American Pitbull Terriers shed just as any average dog does.</blockquote>

            <h2>Misconceptions about the breed</h2>
            <blockquote1>If you tell someone you have a pitbull at home, many people will hear the term "pitbull" and make their own biased assumptions and judgements without any research or even personal experience. Because of the nickname for the breed and because they were once used to track and retrieve smaller animals and also to herd bulls, most people still see the breed as being animal aggressive and even sometimes aggressive towards humans. There have been a multitude of tests done testing the agrression in different breeds of dogs. <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-health/general/1220-american-pit-bull-terrier-temperament-dog-bites"/>

            provides video of the breed getting put through a simulation and compares the results to the results found in other breeds. Although the pitbull breed is the most commonly used breed for things such as dog fighting, it has been proven that there is no link between that fact and the claims of the breed being more prone to aggression. Even though it has been studied and proven that the breed overall is not the #1 most aggressive breed, certain places (i.e., states, cities, apartments.) have breed restrictions against the pitbull. In some cities, if you own a pitbull you are liabe to be fined and have your beloved fur baby taken from you and euthanized.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>The bar graph above lists and shows the percentages of the most tolerant breeds tested. Pit bull terriers are second on the list with 86.8% tolerance, following the Labrador Retriever which has a 92% tolerance when tested. This is just one of many pieces of proof showing that it isn't the breed of dog, but individual dogs and their owners. Many argue that the owners of the dog play a factor in how the dog behaves and its temperament and attitude towards people and other animals.</blockquote>
